# MovieList

## A UIKit project to search for movies using the iTunes API.

### 
* This app uses UIKit and a wholly programmatic UI.
* Users can search for a movie using the name of the movie. The app uses the iTunes API to get results and display the data in a UITableView.
* The user can tap on a result to see more information about that movie and watch the trailer via AVPlayer.
* If the user is interested in watching the movie, they can add it to the favourites list (accessible via the tab bar).
* I chose UserDefaults for persistence of the favourites list as the memory space requirement is small.
* This project really helped me to get practice with the protocol and delegate pattern, coordinators, MVC, and the single responsibility principle.
